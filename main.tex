\section{Appendix}\label{sec:appx}

\subsection{Missing proofs}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition~\ref{thm:urub}] (sketch) One way to deduce the one round protocol is from
  Theorem~\ref{l0}. Alice and Bob run a single pass $L_0$-sampling algorithm
  on $x-y$. This can be achieved by a single message from Alice to Bob
  containing the memory after the first set of updates as in the proof of
  Theorem~\ref{hhl}. The sample $i$ Bob finds is an (almost uniform random)
  index with $x_i\ne y_i$.

Looking more closely to this algorithm we have presented, it finds an index
where $x$ and $y$ disagree from some set $I\subseteq[n]$ that contains at
least one, but not too many such indices. It tries $O(\log n)$ random sets so
that one of them works. One can obtain the two round
protocol by finding such a set in the first round and concentrating on a
single such set in the second round.
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma~\ref{aver}] Using the joint random source the players take a uniform random
  permutation $\pi$ of $[n]$ and use it to permute the digits of $x$ and
  $y$. Further they take a uniform random subset $S\subseteq[n]$ and flip the
  digits with coordinates in $S$. This requires no communication. 
Then they run the original protocol on the modified inputs and report
$\pi^{-1}(i)$ if the original protocol reports $i$. 
All indices where $x$ and $y$ differ are reported with equal probability by
symmetry.
\end{proof}

%\subsection{Space Optimized Heavy Hitters Algorithm}\label{sec:hhUB}
%\begin{theorem}
%[\cite{KaneNPW}]
%\label{thm:hhub}
%Let $x$ be an $n$-dimensional integer vector given by an update stream of $m$
%updates of absolute value at most $M$. There is an $O(\phi^{-p}\log (n/\delta)(\log(mM)+\log\log n))$ space one-pass streaming algorithm which, with probability $1-\delta$, outputs a set $S\subseteq [n]$ such that all $i$ with $|x_i|\geq \phi\|x\|_p$ is in $S$ and $S$ contains no $i$ such that $|x_i|<\frac{\phi}{2}\|x\|_p$.
%\end{theorem}
%\begin{proof}
%Let $\epsilon=\phi^p$, $S = 20\log(n/\delta)$ and $T=64/\epsilon$. Let $h_s: [n]\rightarrow [T]$ be hash functions drawn independently from a 2-wise independent hash family for $s=1,\ldots,S$. We run $ST$ instances of a frequency moment estimation algorithm which gives $1\pm1/16$ approximations to $\|v\|_p^p$ with probability $7/8$, where $v$ are suitably defined sub-vectors of $x$. We refer to each instance of frequency moment estimation algorithm as $D[s,t]$ where $s\in [S]$ and $t\in [T]$.
%The space requirement is $O(\log(mM) + \log\log n)$ per instance, using the algorithm of \cite{KaneNW10}.
%
%Given an update $(i,u)$, we feed it to $D[s,h_{s}(i)]$ for all $s\in [S]$.  Let $C[s,t]$ be the output of the algorithm $D[s,t]$ at the end of the stream. For any $t\in[T]$ and $s\in[S]$, we have
%\begin{align*}
%\E\left[\sum_{i:h_s(i)=t}|x_i|^p\right] = \epsilon \|x\|_p^p/64.
%\end{align*}
%Hence, by an application of Markov's inequality and union bound, with probability 3/4 we have
%\begin{align*}
%(1-1/16)|x_i|^p \leq C[s,t] \leq (1+1/16)(|x_i|^p + \epsilon \|x\|^p_p/8).
%\end{align*}
%Let $e_i$ be the average of $C[s,h_s(i)]$ for $s\in[S]$. By Chernoff bounds, with probability $1-\delta$
%\begin{align*}
%(6/7)|x_i|^p \leq e_i \leq (7/6)(|x_i|^p + \epsilon \|x\|^p_p/8)
%\end{align*}
%for all $i\in [n]$. Hence we can tell apart $i$ for which $|x_i|\geq\phi\|x\|_p$ from $j$ for which $|x_j|<\frac{\phi}{2}\|x\|_p$. The algorithm takes $O(\phi^{-p}\log(n/\delta)(\log(mM)+\log\log n))$ bits as we run $O(\epsilon^{-1}\log(n/\delta))$ instances of the frequency moment estimator of \cite{KaneNW10}.
%\end{proof}
